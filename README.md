# 🔰 StarterKit Workflow

This is the starter kit for a Cyware workflow JS script.

Check out our documentation on [workflows](https://cyware.github.io/docs/concepts/workflows.html).

You don't need to use this to use worklows, this is really only to help you with more complex JS node scripts.

## 🏎️ Usage

1. `npm i`
1. Make some modifications in `src`
1. `npm run build`
1. Copy the content of `script.js` in `dist` into the JS node
1. (Optional) Use the generated `workflow.json` in `dist`

## 💡 Workflow Template

If you have a stable workflow, you can `Download` it from Cyware and use it as a template.
The build process will inject the script where you put the tag `[REPLACE_SCRIPT]`.
You can take inspiration from `workflow.template.json`
